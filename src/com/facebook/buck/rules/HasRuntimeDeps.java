/**
 * Provides a facility for a rule to list dependencies it'll need at runtime.
 * <p>
 * Consider the case of a Java test.  The {@link com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.JavaTest} rule itself is
 * just a {@link com.facebook.buck.jvm.java.DefaultJavaLibrary} and so only lists its immediate compile
 * time deps as its normal first-order dependencies.  However, to actually run a Java test, we need
 * it's entire transitive dependency tree locally on disk.  Since this is outside the contract of
 * normal build dependencies (e.g. a top-down build engine may decide not to pull a dependency
 * locally if the top-level target can be pulled from cache, and therefore won't need to be built),
 * we need some other way to convey to the build engine that a set of rules that need to be on disk
 * by the end of the build.
 * <p>
 * Enter this interface.  While it serves an important purpose, its long-term semantics aren't
 * entirely clear yet, so expect how we model this and how the build engine uses this to change in
 * the future.
